## Building
To build using the Makefile, you need the following libraries installed onto your *system* lib:
    - [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl) for stream parsing.
    - [yyjson](https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson) to be able to work with JSONs in C without going insane.
    - [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) to parse URLs.
    - SQLite (duh!)

To install yajl and libcurl Ubuntu, for example:

```bash
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev openssl libcurl4-openssl-dev libyajl-dev
```

yyjson isn't available on apt, so we have to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson
cd yyjson
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
sudo make install
```

Then `cd` back into the root and run to build the extension file `libyarts.so`:

```bash
make
```

And that's it!

## Other Scripts
To install / uninstall the VHS API header `vapi.h` from your usr local lib:

```bash
sudo make install
sudo make uninstall
```

To run the test script, make sure you have the binary built at the project root.
Then you can run the npm script:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

## Library
The majority of the code is under `src/lib`, where a select number of functions
are exposed to the extension `vhs.c` file via the `vapi.h` header.

If you've installed the API via the `make install` command, you can use the helper functions
in standalone code by compiling with the `-lvapi` flag. To compile the queue printer example script:

```
gcc stream_print.c -lvapi
```

## Documentation
This project uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) for code documentation
and uses [Docusaurus](http://docusaurus.io/) for the tutorial docs.
